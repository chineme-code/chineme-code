I am a graduate student at the University of New Mexico, and Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ll be graduating in December 2024. As an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst, my focus areas include Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, Digital Forensics, and Web Security. I have a profound interest in technology and a strong dedication to solving complex problems. I enjoy working on labs and continually learning new aspects of the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity. Though Iâ€™m relatively new to the field, Iâ€™m proud of the progress Iâ€™ve made so far and am eager to continue growing.

## Objective
My journey in cybersecurity has ignited a passion for protecting digital assets, and I am now focused on transitioning into a professional role within this field. My ultimate goal is to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to help defend against cyber threats.
